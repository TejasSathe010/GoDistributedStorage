# GoDistributedStorage - Distributed CAS Storage in Golang

This project aims to build a distributed content-addressable storage (CAS) system in Golang, leveraging peer-to-peer (P2P) protocols, RPC networking, and streaming techniques.

## Project Descriptions

1. **Let's Build A Distributed CAS Storage in Golang**
   - Develop a scalable distributed CAS storage system in Golang.
   
2. **P2P Protocol in Golang for My Distributed CAS**
   - Implement a peer-to-peer (P2P) protocol in Golang tailored for the distributed CAS storage system.

3. **Distributed CAS Storage in Golang - RPC Networking**
   - Use RPC networking in Golang to enable communication between distributed nodes in the CAS storage system.

4. **Streaming Large Files in Golang But Distributed**
   - Implement streaming techniques in Golang to efficiently handle the transfer and storage of large files within the distributed CAS storage system.

5. **Writing Tests for My Distributed File Storage in Golang**
   - Develop comprehensive tests in Golang to validate the functionality and performance of the distributed CAS storage system.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
